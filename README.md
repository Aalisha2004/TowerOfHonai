# Tower of Hanoi - Java Implementation

This repository contains a simple Java program that solves the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem using **recursion**.

## ðŸ§  What is the Tower of Hanoi?

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three rods (or towers) and a number of disks of different sizes. The puzzle starts with all disks stacked in decreasing size on one rod, and the objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. All disks must be moved using an auxiliary (helper) rod.

The minimum number of moves required is `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the number of disks.
